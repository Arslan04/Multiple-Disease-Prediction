# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
This project presents a comprehensive system for the prediction of multiple diseases, including heart disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, cancer, and brain tumors. 
The system utilizes various machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to predict the likelihood of these diseases based on input parameters.
For the prediction of brain tumors, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was employed due to its effectiveness in image classification tasks.
The system is integrated into a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input relevant parameters for each disease and obtain predictions instantly. The selection of the best-performing model for each disease was based on accuracy scores obtained during model training and evaluation.
Overall, this project demonstrates the utility of machine learning and deep learning techniques in healthcare for disease prediction, with potential applications in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
